Learning computer vision and image processing.

### Main projects
including some projects in the "Digit Image Processing" course.
 - 01 - histogram-equalization-pro: some algorithms which based on the histogram equalization.
 - 02 - retinex: implement and compare different retinex algorithms, like SSR, MSR, MSRCR etc.
 - 03 - haze-night-image-enhancement: implement Dark Channel algorithm to enhance haze and night images.
 - 04 - UM-AUM: implement and compare Unsharp Masking and Adaptive Unsharp Masking algorithms.
